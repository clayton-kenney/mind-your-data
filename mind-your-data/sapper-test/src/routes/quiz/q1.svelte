<h2>Webcam Challenge</h2> 
<p>If your computer has a built-in camera, also known as a webcam, you should know that it can be used to spy on you. And no, this is not just science fiction as a recent survey conducted by HP shows that 10% in the U.S. either know someone whose webcam was hacked or have had their own webcam hacked.</p>
